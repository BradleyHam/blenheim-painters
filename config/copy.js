      {
        question: "How does Marlborough's climate affect paint choices?",
        answer: "Marlborough's intense UV (2,400+ sunshine hours) and dry conditions require specific paints. We use UV-stable products with heat-reflective properties and flexibility for temperature variations. Standard paints often fail within 2-3 years here."

      {
        question: "Best time of year to paint in Blenheim?",

        question: "Can you work around grape harvest?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We understand the wine industry calendar and can schedule work outside of vintage (March-April) or work quietly during harvest. Many vineyards prefer painting during winter when it's quieter."
