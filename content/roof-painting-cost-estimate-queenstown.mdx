## How the Roof Painting Quote Request Works

3. **Submit your request:** Your info goes straight to Daniel's inbox for review.
4. **Get your personalized quote:** Daniel will follow up with a tailored estimate and advice based on your specific situation.

*Note: Each quote is personally prepared by Daniel based on your specific roof and requirements.*

## What Actually Affects Roof Painting Costs in Queenstown & NZ

| Factor                    | Why It Matters                                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Roof size**             | More metres = more paint and labour. Accurate measurements avoid surprises. |
| **Roof type/profile**     | Iron sprays fast. Tiles or decramastic need more prep and edge work. |
| **Current condition**     | Rust, peeling paint, lichen, or repairs increase prep and material costs. |
| **Pitch (angle)**         | Steep roofs need scaffolding and take longer—extra cost for safety. |
| **Access**                | Tight sites, tall homes, glass balustrades slow things down and may require more equipment. |
| **Paint system**          | Premium paints last longer in Queenstown's climate, but cost more up front. |
