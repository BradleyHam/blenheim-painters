# Commercial Office Refresh Project

This innovative tech startup in Frankton had outgrown their original office space aesthetically and functionally. What began as a simple repaint evolved into a comprehensive workspace transformation that enhanced both employee satisfaction and client impression while maintaining full business operations throughout the project.

## Project Background

### The Client Challenge
**Growing Tech Company**: 45-employee software development firm
**Operational Constraints**: 24/7 development cycles requiring zero downtime
**Brand Evolution**: Company rebranding needed reflection in physical space
**Employee Satisfaction**: Desire to create inspiring, modern workspace
**Client Impression**: Need for professional appearance for investor meetings

### Existing Conditions
**Original Space**: 800mÂ² open-plan office with private meeting rooms
**Current Colors**: Builder-grade white walls throughout
**Lighting**: Mix of natural and fluorescent lighting
**Layout**: Functional but uninspiring workspace design
**Age**: 8-year-old building with good bones but dated appearance

## Design and Planning Phase

### Stakeholder Consultation
We conducted extensive consultations with multiple stakeholder groups:

**Management Team**:
- Budget parameters and timeline requirements
- Brand color integration and corporate identity needs
- Productivity and employee satisfaction goals

**Employee Survey**:
- Workspace color preferences and psychological needs
- Areas of concern or desired improvement
- Workflow impact considerations

**HR Department**:
- Employee wellness and satisfaction objectives
- Recruitment and retention benefit potential
- Change management and communication needs

### Color Psychology for Workplace Design
Working with workplace psychology principles, we developed a strategic color plan:

**Productivity Zones**: Cool blues and greens to enhance focus and concentration
**Collaboration Areas**: Warm, energizing colors to stimulate creativity and communication
**Rest Areas**: Calming neutrals to provide visual relief and relaxation
**Brand Integration**: Strategic use of company colors throughout

## Strategic Color Scheme

### Primary Palette Development
**Corporate Integration**: 
- **Primary Brand Blue**: Deep, professional blue reflecting company identity
- **Secondary Brand Green**: Fresh, innovative green suggesting growth and technology
- **Neutral Base**: Sophisticated grays providing professional foundation
- **Accent Orange**: Energizing pops of color for creativity zones

### Zone-Specific Applications

**Open-Plan Work Areas**:

**Common Areas**:
- **Kitchen/Break room**: Fresh white with cheerful yellow accents

- **Corridors**: Light, airy colors to enhance natural lighting

## Project Management and Scheduling

The key challenge was maintaining full business operations while transforming the workspace.

**Phased Approach**:
