> **Quick take:** Go **flat or low-sheen** on ceilings for flawless light diffusion, **eggshell or satin** on living areas for wipe-ability, and **semi-gloss or gloss** on trim for bullet-proof durability.

## Why paint sheen matters more than colour

Two identical colours can look wildly different—and age very differently—depending on the finish you choose. Higher gloss:

1. **Reflects more light** – highlights surface imperfections.
2. **Builds a harder film** – better stain and scuff resistance.
3. **Costs more** – extra resin means higher RRP.

Understanding these trade-offs saves you re-painting (and money) down the track.

## NZ sheen terminology cheat-sheet

| Finish (NZ/AU label) | Typical gloss level at 60° | Where it shines |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Flat / Matt          | < 5 %                     | Ceilings, media rooms |
| Low-Sheen            | 5–10 %                    | Bedrooms, feature walls |
| **Eggshell / Pearl** | 10–20 %                   | Living areas, hallways |
| **Satin**            | 20–35 %                   | Kitchens, bathrooms |
| **Semi-Gloss**       | 35–60 %                   | Timber trim, doors |
| **Full Gloss**       | > 85 %                    | Front doors, feature cabinetry |

> *Pro tip:* NZ suppliers sometimes merge eggshell into satin—always check the spec sheet for gloss % rather than marketing names.

## Room-by-room recommendations

### 1. Ceilings

- **Best finish:** *Flat or Ultra-Flat*
- **Why:** Hides joints and stopping lines in GIB®; minimal light bounce reduces glare.
- **Resene option:** *Resene Ceiling Flat* (93 % maximum light scatter)

### 2. Bedrooms & lounges

- **Best finish:** *Low-Sheen or Eggshell*
- **Why:** Soft look, scrub-able up to **8,000 wet rubs** (per Dulux Wash&Wear Low-Sheen).
- **Bonus:** Lower sheen mutes minor wall undulations common in older Queenstown villas.

### 3. Kitchens & bathrooms

- **Best finish:** *Satin*
- **Why:** Condensation and cooking splatter demand a tighter, washable film. Satin offers mildew-resistant additives without the mirror glare of semi-gloss.
- **Brand pick:** *Dulux Aquanamel Satin* – moisture and steam tolerant.

### 4. Doors, skirtings & windowsills

- **Best finish:** *Semi-Gloss or Gloss enamel hybrid*
- **Why:** Handles vacuums, muddy boots and dog claws. Higher resin content = harder finish.
- **Speed hack:** Use a water-based enamel (e.g., *Resene Enamacryl Gloss*) for 2-hour re-coat and low odour.

### 5. Feature walls & front doors

- **Best finish:** *Full Gloss or High-Gloss 2K system*
- **Why:** Dramatic shine makes colours pop; Best UV resistance for bold hues.
- **Caveat:** Laser-level prep—gloss will amplify every dent.

## Queenstown durability field data (2021-2024)

| Room | Finish used | Touch-ups required after 3 years |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Kid’s bedroom | Low-Sheen acrylic | **2** minor scuff repairs |
| Kitchen | Satin acrylic | **0** – wiped weekly |
| Hallway trim | Semi-Gloss enamel | **0** – still pristine |

## Cost impact (Mitre 10 pricing, July 2025)

| Finish | Avg. $/L | % Price vs Low-Sheen |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Flat | $24 | –10 % |
| Low-Sheen | $27 | Base |
| Eggshell | $29 | +7 % |
| Satin | $31 | +15 % |
| Semi-Gloss | $34 | +26 % |
| Gloss | $36 | +33 % |

## FAQs

### Is higher gloss always more durable?
Generally yes, but modern premium low-sheen lines rival mid-gloss for scrub resistance—check the scrub-cycle rating.

### Can I mix sheens in one space?
Absolutely. A popular combo is eggshell walls with semi-gloss trim for subtle contrast.

### How do I test glare?
Paint an A4 off-cut of GIB®, place it under your room lighting at night—you’ll instantly see if reflections are distracting.
