> **Quick take:** Aim for dry, mild days.. ideally **15–25 °C** with humidity under **70 %**.. and you'll get a coat that cures hard and keeps its colour.

## Why timing matters

Paint needs the right combo of **temperature, humidity and UV** to cure. Too cold and it stays soft; too hot and it skins over before it bonds. New Zealand's wild micro-climates mean the "right time" shifts by region.

## North Island vs. South Island cheat-sheet

| Region | Prime Painting Window | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Northland & Auckland | Sept – May | Sub-tropical showers.. watch the hourly forecast. |
| Waikato & Bay of Plenty | Oct – Apr | High humidity.. paint late morning once dew burns off. |
| Wellington & Kapiti | Nov – Mar | Northerlies can dust-blast wet paint.. set wind breaks. |
| Christchurch & Canterbury | Oct – Mar | Dry nor'wester helps cure but plan around nor'easter drizzle. |
| Otago & Queenstown Lakes | Dec – Feb | Alpine nights drop below 10 °C till late spring.. use fast-curing paints outside this window. |

## Temp & humidity rules of thumb

1. **Daytime high ≥ 15 °C** for at least four hours after you finish a coat.
2. **Overnight low ≥ 10 °C** to avoid condensation blooming the film.
3. **Relative humidity < 70 %**.. check your phone's weather app.
4. **Surface must be dry** (a dry footpath is a good proxy).

## Can you paint in winter?

Yes.. if you **must**. Use cold-cure acrylics rated to **5 °C**, start after the frost lifts, and finish by 2 pm so the film skins before dusk. Expect longer re-coat times.

## Pro tips for a bulletproof finish

- **Log the forecast:** MetService's hourly graph is your best mate.
- **Start on the shady side:** Follow the sun to avoid blistering.
- **Mind the dew:** Stop two hours before sunset when temperatures dip.
- **Store paint indoors overnight:** Keeps viscosity consistent.
- **Add 5 % water on hot days:** Slows flash-off (always follow spec sheet).

## FAQs

### How long after rain can I paint?

When the surface is bone-dry.. typically 24 hours of clear weather. Timber weatherboards may need longer.

### What's the maximum temperature?

Most exterior acrylics top out at **30 °C**; darker colours absorb heat faster, so aim for < 25 °C.

### Do I need to reschedule if humidity spikes midday?

Not usually.. humidity rises as paint dries. Just ensure the first hour after application meets the < 70 % rule.
