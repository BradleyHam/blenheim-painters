> **Quick take:** Queenstown homes can drop to 0 °C overnight while indoor humidity spikes from showers, cooking and clothes drying. That combo breeds mould fast unless surfaces are sealed and rooms breathe.

## Why Condensation Hits Hard in Alpine Towns

- **Big temperature gaps** – warm interiors meet icy windows, turning water vapour into droplets.  
- **Tight modern builds** – double glazing keeps heat in but traps moisture.  
- **Short winter days** – less sunlight means longer drying times on cold walls.

*Unchecked condensation feeds black mould within weeks, stains paint and triggers asthma.*

## Five-Step Condensation Control Plan

1. **Vent first, paint second**  
   - Fit extraction fans that push 150 m³/h minimum.  
   - Run dehumidifiers below 60 % RH during prep and cure.

2. **Treat existing mould**  
   - Mix 1 part bleach to 4 parts water.  
   - Scrub, rinse, let dry 24 h before priming.

3. **Prime right**  
   - Use **Resene Sureseal** or **Dulux 1-Step** on stained areas.  
   - Spot-prime any filler to even out porosity.

4. **Apply two coats**  
   - Keep room 12 – 22 °C for the full cure window.  
   - Maintain cross-flow ventilation without creating dust.

5. **Maintain year-round**  
   - Wipe window sills daily in deep winter.  
   - Re-caulk wet-area gaps every two years.

## Quick DIY Checks Each Winter

| Task | What to Look For | Fix |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Window beads | Black spots or flaky paint | Sand, prime, recoat with mould-resistant paint |
| Wardrobe backs | Musty smell or grey film | Increase airflow, add passive vent grills |
| Bathroom ceiling | Condensation after 30 min | Upgrade fan or extend run-on timer |

## Energy-Smart Colour Picks

- **Soft terracotta neutrals** bounce low winter light and feel warmer.  
- **Mid-tone greens** pair well with timber trims and hide scuffs.  
- **Off-white ceilings** lift perceived height and reflect heater warmth back down.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does anti-mould paint work without ventilation?

It helps but cannot overcome high humidity alone. Pair coatings with good airflow for lasting results.

### How long should I wait before wiping down freshly painted walls?

Seven days. After that, a damp microfibre cloth is safe for low-sheen acrylics.

### Can I add anti-fungal additive to leftover paint?

Yes. Most paint stores sell small sachets that stir straight in. Match brand to paint type for compatibility.
