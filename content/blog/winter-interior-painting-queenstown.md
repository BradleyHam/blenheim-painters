## Why Winter Is the Perfect Time to Paint Indoors

- **Lower humidity** – Queenstown’s crisp air speeds up acrylic cure times.
- **Contractor availability** – crews are less stacked with exterior work, so bookings come faster and often cheaper.
- **Cosy colour reset** – warm neutrals and earthy accents make rooms feel snug when temperatures drop.
- **Healthy indoor air** – fresh low-VOC coatings seal old paint dust and stop mould spores from circulating.

## Best Paint Options for Queenstown Interiors

| Paint type | Pros | Watch-outs |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Low-VOC Acrylic** | Fast drying, minimal odour, easy clean-up | Avoid cheap brands that scuff easily |
| **Washable Matte** | Hides imperfections, modern finish | Needs gentle cleaning – no harsh scrubs |
| **Kitchen & Bath Semi-Gloss** | Moisture and stain resistance | Highlight surface flaws if prep is poor |
| **Two-Part Epoxy** | Bullet-proof for garage floors and laundries | Strong smell during application, higher cost |

## Colour Trends to Warm Up Winter

- **Soft clay tones** – Resene *Quarter Arrowtown* or Dulux *Terracotta Chip* add subtle warmth.
- **Deep forest greens** – pair with timber trims for alpine lodge vibes.
- **Creamy off-whites** – Resene *Half Bianca* bounces scarce winter light without feeling sterile.
- **Two-tone walls** – darker lower third grounds the room and hides scuffs; lighter upper two-thirds lifts ceiling height visually.

## Prep Checklist for Flawless Interior Results

1. **Declutter and dust** – wipe skirting boards and vac corners.
2. **Fix dents and gaps** – use flexible filler, sand smooth once dry.
3. **Mask edges** – crisp lines on ceilings, trims and sockets save touch-ups later.
4. **Prime stained spots** – water stains or tannin bleed need a stain-block primer.
5. **Vent and heat** – run heat pump or dehumidifier to keep room between 12 °C and 22 °C.

## Step-by-Step Winter Painting Workflow

1. **Cut in ceilings and corners** first so roller laps stay wet.
2. **Roll walls top to bottom** using a 12 mm nap for low-sheen finishes.
3. **Flash off heater** while rolling to avoid rapid skinning.
4. **Second coat after two hours** if surface stays above 12 °C and feels dry to touch.
5. **Re-install furniture** next day; full cure takes seven days, so go easy on freshly painted walls.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will paint smell linger when windows stay shut?

No. Modern low-VOC formulas flash off quickly. Run a dehumidifier or fan for the first evening and odour will vanish.

### Can I paint interior trims when it’s below freezing outside?

Yes, as long as room temperature holds above 10 °C during and three hours after application. Keep heaters on and windows closed until paint is touch-dry.

### What finish is best for kids’ rooms?

A washable low-sheen or eggshell. It resists grubby fingers yet hides plaster imperfections better than full satin.
