> **Quick take:** Queenstown winters are cold, wet and UV-intense even on clear days. A fresh coat of flexible, mould-resistant paint is the cheapest insurance you can buy for timber, render and cladding.

## Why Act Now – Late Autumn Weather Facts

- **Average lows hit 0 °C by early June** while daytime highs hover around 8 °C.  
- **Rainfall averages 80-100 mm** in May, pushing moisture deep into unsealed boards.  
- **Freeze-thaw cycles** force trapped water to expand, cracking paint films and timber.

Painting before the first frost lets coatings cure properly and seals micro-gaps that waste heat.

## Priority Exterior Touch-Points

| Area | Risk if Ignored | Recommended Product |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fascia & soffits | Rot from roof run-off | Resene Lumbersider Low-Sheen |
| South-facing walls | Persistent damp & mould | Dulux Weathershield Semi-Gloss |
| Decks & rails | Splitting from freeze-thaw | Resene Woodsman Decking Oil |
| Window trims | Cracking that lets water in | Dulux Aquanamel Satin |

*Tip: match product sheen to existing finish for a seamless look.*

## The Perfect Late-Autumn Workflow

1. **Wash & de-mould** – hit walls with house wash plus sodium hypochlorite solution.  
2. **Inspect & repair** – fill hairline cracks, replace soft boards.  
3. **Mask & cover** plants, lights and heat-pump units.  
4. **Prime bare spots** with Resene Wood Primer or Dulux 1-Step.  
5. **Apply two coats** of high-flex acrylic, keeping a wet edge.  
6. **Cure indoors overnight** – store brushes and rollers in airtight bags to prevent frost damage.

## Interior Painting – Perfect Winter Project

Cold outside? Warm up the inside:

- **Create cosy neutrals** in living rooms with Resene Half Tea or Dulux Ōkārito.  
- **Low-VOC formulas** mean windows stay shut and heat stays in.  
- **Quick weekend refresh:** one accent wall plus door trims makes a room pop for under $250 in materials.

## Maintenance Checklist Before the First Frost

- Clear gutters and downpipes – prevents overflow rot.  
- Trim branches touching cladding – reduces moisture transfer.  
- Check caulking around windows – re-seal any gaps.  
- Repaint steel handrails – stop rust before salt and snow speed it up.  
- Book a **free exterior check-up** with us – we’ll spot issues you might miss.

## Real Project Spotlight – Queenstown Hill Render Re-paint (May 2025)

![Freshly repainted modern duplex in neutral alpine tones](/exteriors/render-walls-exterior-repaint-queenstown.jpg)

> **Project scope:** Full exterior repaint of rendered masonry walls, timber garage doors, and metal trim on a steep Queenstown Hill driveway.

**Products & process**

| Surface | Prep & Repair | Coating System |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Rendered walls | Pressure-wash (3,000 psi) • anti-mould treatment • fill hairline cracks with Resene Brushable Elastomeric | **Resene X-200 Weathertight Membrane**, 2 coats, tinted “Quarter Stonewall” |
| Timber garage doors | Sand to bare grain • timber reviver wash | **Resene Waterborne Woodsman** (Natural), 2 flood coats |
| Metal balustrades & parapet flashings | Degrease • scuff-sand • spot-prime rust | **Dulux Metalshield Epoxy Primer** + **Metalshield Satin Black** top-coat |

**Challenges we tackled**

- **Autumn temperature swings** – we planned work on sun-facing elevations before midday and moved to shaded walls in the afternoon to keep surface temps ≥ 10 °C.  
- **Steep access** – scaffold tied into terrace retaining walls for safe footing.  
- **Fine hairline cracking** in the render – elastomeric filler plus X-200’s flexible film now bridges movement and stops water ingress.

**Winter-ready benefits**

- Seam-sealed render prevents freeze-thaw damage and interior damp spots.  
- Darker parapet flashings absorb late-afternoon sun, reducing ice build-up on gutters.  
- Oiled timber doors now repel rain and won’t silver over the colder months, maintaining premium street appeal.

*Result: the owners gained an extra 8–10 years of protection and a warmer, drier interior before Queenstown’s first frost hit.*

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you paint outside once winter starts?

Yes, but temperature must stay above 10 °C for at least three hours after application. We prefer wrapping exteriors by end-May.

### What finish lasts longest in alpine conditions?

Low-sheen or satin acrylics flex with timber movement and hide imperfections better than high-gloss.

### How soon can I wash newly painted walls?

Give exterior coatings seven dry days before using a low-pressure hose. Interiors can be wiped gently after two weeks.
