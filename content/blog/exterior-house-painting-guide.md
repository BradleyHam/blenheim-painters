## Why Queenstown's Climate Demands Special Paint

- **Temperature swings** – summer highs vs. sub‑zero winter mornings
- **Freeze‑thaw cycles** – moisture behind paint expands and peels
- **High UV exposure** – altitude intensifies colour fade

Choose **UV‑resistant, flexible, mould‑inhibiting** systems like **Resene Lumbersider** or **Dulux Weathershield**.

## Best Paint Types for Alpine Exteriors

| Paint type | Pros | Watch‑outs |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **100 % Acrylic** | Flexible, fast‑drying, low‑VOC | Prime raw timber first |
| **Oil‑based Enamel** | Rock‑hard finish for trims | Longer dry‑time, higher VOC |
| **Elastomeric** | Bridges hairline cracks | Thicker film = brush marks if rushed |

## Prep Like a Pro (Queenstown Edition)

1. **Wash & scrub** – house‑wash + anti‑mould treatment  
2. **Repair & patch** – flexible fillers / replace rotten weatherboards  
3. **Scrape & sand** – feather edges until smooth  
4. **Prime** – stain‑blocking or Hi‑Build where needed

## Timing Your Project

| Season | Risk | Ideal action |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Sep‑Apr | Warm & dry | Main painting window |
| May‑Aug | Frost & rain | Only small touch‑ups |
| Daily min temp | **≥ 10 C** | Most paints need this to cure |

## Step‑by‑Step Painting Workflow

1. Work on **shaded sides first** to avoid lap marks.  
2. **Cut in** edges & trims.  
3. **Roll large areas** for uniform film build.  
4. Apply **two full coats** (third on sun‑blasted facades).  
5. Respect **manufacturer cure times** between coats.

## Pro Tips for Queenstown Homeowners

- **Swatch outdoors** – alpine light shifts colours dramatically.  
- **Secure scaff & sunscreen** – safety + UV protection for *you* too.  
- **Consider a professional** – steep sites & two‑storeys add risk.  
- **Chat to local paint reps** – they track which products survive here.  
<!-- - **Compare prep vs. repaint cost** – see our [Queenstown cost guide](/blog/cost-to-paint-house-queenstown-2025) for numbers. -->

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I really need primer on previously painted weatherboards?

> **Yes.** Primer seals repaired spots and evens porosity so top‑coat colour stays consistent.

### What finish lasts longest in cold climates?

> **Low‑sheen or satin** – hides imperfections & flexes with timber movement.

### How often will I need to repaint?

> Every **8–10 years** if high‑quality systems & prep are used.
