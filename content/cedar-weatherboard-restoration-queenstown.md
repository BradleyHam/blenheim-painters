> **Quick take:** Queenstown's 1,600m elevation means 40% more UV exposure than coastal areas. Without proper protection, cedar weatherboards fade to silver-grey within 24 months and start splitting by year 5. Smart restoration adds 10-15 years of life.

## Why Queenstown's UV Hits Cedar Harder

At our altitude, the atmosphere filters less harmful radiation. Combined with:

- **Reflected UV from Lake Wakatipu** – water bounces an extra 10-15% UV back at your home
- **Snow reflection in winter** – doubles UV exposure on south-facing walls
- **Thin air at 310m above sea level** – less atmospheric protection than Auckland or Wellington
- **300+ sunny days annually** – more cumulative exposure than most NZ locations

*Result: Cedar that would last 8-10 years in Auckland deteriorates in 3-5 years here.*

## The Four Stages of Cedar Weathering

### Stage 1: Fresh Installation (0-12 months)
- **Appearance:** Rich golden-brown colour, smooth texture
- **Action needed:** Apply initial UV-protective oil within 6 months
- **Cost to maintain:** $2-4 per m² for quality oil

### Stage 2: Early Fading (1-3 years)
- **Appearance:** Colour dulls to light brown, surface feels slightly rough
- **Action needed:** Deep clean and re-oil with tinted product
- **Cost to restore:** $6-8 per m² including prep

### Stage 3: Silver-Grey Patina (3-7 years)
- **Appearance:** Uniform grey colour, raised grain, water absorption increases
- **Action needed:** Sand back to fresh timber, prime and stain
- **Cost to restore:** $15-20 per m² including sanding

### Stage 4: Structural Deterioration (7+ years)
- **Appearance:** Cracking, splitting, black mould in joints
- **Action needed:** Board replacement + full restoration
- **Cost to restore:** $35-50 per m² including replacement boards

## Proven Restoration Process for Queenstown Climate

### 1. Assessment & Preparation
- **Moisture test:** Use digital meter—boards must be <18% moisture
- **Damage mapping:** Photo-document splits, loose boards, mould patches
- **Weather window:** Plan for 4-5 consecutive dry days (Nov-Mar ideal)

### 2. Cleaning & Sanding
- **Pressure wash:** 1,200 PSI maximum to avoid grain damage
- **Sanding:** 80-grit to remove grey surface, 120-grit for smooth finish
- **Dust removal:** Compressed air + tack cloth (critical for adhesion)

### 3. Repair & Prime
- **Fill splits:** Exterior-grade wood filler, sand flush when dry
- **Prime bare wood:** **Resene Aquaprime** or **Dulux Timber Primer**
- **Spot-prime repairs:** Ensure even porosity across all surfaces

### 4. Protective Coating Application
| Product | Coverage | Durability | Best For |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Dryden Colourtone+** | 8-10 m²/L | 5-7 years | North/west-facing walls |
| **Resene Waterborne Woodsman** | 6-8 m²/L | 4-6 years | Budget-friendly option |
| **Cabot's Deck & Exterior Stain** | 8-12 m²/L | 6-8 years | High-traffic areas |

## Common Mistakes That Shorten Cedar Life

1. **Painting over weathered timber** – Paint film traps moisture and peels within 12 months
2. **Using interior products** – Lacks UV blockers needed for alpine exposure
3. **Skipping primer on bare wood** – Reduces coating adhesion by 60%
4. **Applying in direct sunlight** – Causes rapid curing and poor penetration

## When to Call a Professional

### DIY-Friendly Tasks
- Annual washing and inspection
- Touch-up coating on small areas
- Basic caulking and minor repairs

### Professional Territory
- Extensive sanding (dust control + speed)
- Multi-story access work

## FAQ

### How long does restoration take?
A typical single-story home takes 3-4 days: 1 day prep, 1 day sanding, 1 day priming, 1 day coating.

### Can I restore cedar in winter?
Yes, but only on dry days above 12°C. Winter oils cure slower but still provide protection.

### Is it worth restoring vs. replacing?
If boards are structurally sound (no deep splits), restoration costs 30-40% less than replacement.

### What about the "weathered look"?
Natural greying is fine aesthetically, but increases water absorption 300%. Expect accelerated deterioration without protection.
